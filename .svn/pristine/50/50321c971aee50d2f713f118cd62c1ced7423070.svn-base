This is HW04 for COMP310, where we implement various painting strategies for our BallWorld,
and add command dispatching.

This project has added functionality to what we had for HW03. Now, we also have paint strategies,
that work with the update strategies we have (unless something deals with the color, since we
currently do not support dynamically changing the color of an image).

The paint strategies we support, as required by the rubric are...

Non-affine transform-based paint strategy, i.e. directly implements IPaintStrategy:
	1) This is BallPaintStrategy, which is just typed in the GUI as 'Ball' without the quotes.
	2) This is SquarePaintStrategy, which is just typed in the GUI as 'Square' without the quotes.
Affine transform-based paint strategy:
	Simple geometric shape and/or polygon:
		3) This is EllipsePaintStrategy, which is just typed in the GUI as 'Ellipse' without the quotes.
		4) This is RectanglePaintStrategy, which is just typed in the GUI as 'Rectangle' without the quotes.
	Composite shape that stays upright:
		5) This is UprightCompositeStrategy, which is just typed in the GUI as 'Composite' without the quotes.
	Image:
		6) This is ImagePaintStrategy, which is just typed in the GUI as the image you want to draw starting
		with a capital character, following by 'Image' without the quotes. The currently supported images are
			-EarthImage
			-HumbirdImage
			-JupiterImage
			-MarioImage
			-MarsImage
			-ReefImage
			-SaturnImage
			-SheepImage
			-SoccerImage
			-SonicImage
			-VenusImage
